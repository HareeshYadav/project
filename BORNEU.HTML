In general, Asian elephants are smaller than African elephants<P> and have the highest body point on the head.
The tip of their trunk has one finger-like process.<P> Their back is convex or level.
It has become commonplace to refer to the Borneo elephant as a ‘pygmy’ subspecies,<P> although adult elephants<P>of Sabah of both genders are similar in height to their counterparts in Peninsular Malaysia. Five measurements >P>of the skull of a fully adult female elephant from Gomantong Forest<P> Reserve were slightly smaller (72–90%) <P>than comparable dimensions averaged for two Sumatran skulls. Few available measurements show that they <P>are of similar size to other populations of the Sunda subregion.[2)Morphological measurements of fifteen captive<P> elephants from Peninsular Malaysia and of six elephants from<P Sabah were taken between April 2005 and January <P>2006, and repeated three times for each elephant and averaged.<P> There was no significant difference in any of the characters between the two captive populations.[5]They are also remarkably tame and passive, another reason <P>some scientists think they descended from a domestic collection<CENTER><p><img src= "81.jpg"  STYLE="WIDTH:500PX; HEIGHT : 400PX"></P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
