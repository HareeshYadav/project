The Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus) is one of three recognized<P> subspecies of the Asian elephant,
and native to the Indonesia island of Sumatra. In 2011, the Sumatran elephant has been <P>classified as critically endangered by IUCN as the population has declined by at least 80% over the last three generations, estimated to be about 75 years.<P> The subspecies is pre-eminently threatened by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and poaching; over 69% of potential elephant habitat has been lost within the last 25 years.<P> Much of the remaining forest cover is in blocks smaller than 250 km2 (97 sq mi), which are too small to contain viable elephant populations.
<P> Due to conversion of forests into human settlements and agricultural areas, many of the Sumatran elephant<P> populations have lost their habitat humans.As a result, many elephants have been removed <P> the wild or directly killed. Between 1985 and 2007, 50% of Sumatran elephants died.[1] Between 1980 <P>and 2005, 69% of potential Sumatran elephanT habitat was lost within just one elephant generation, and the driving<P> forces that caused this habitat loss still remain essentially unchecked. There is clear, direct evidence from two<P> provinces, Riau anLampung, which shows entire elephant populations have disappeared as a result of habitat loss <CENTER><p><img src= "00.jpg"  STYLE="WIDTH:500PX; HEIGHT : 400PX"></P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
